This cream was very rich and thick and creamy, which worked great to rehydrate my skin and especially helped sooth the eczema on my forehead. I would definitely purchase again and recommend this product to anyone with dry winter skin or just looking for a hydrating face cream.",

    "thoughtText": "When I put it on, my skin felt so, so happy and relieved. First moisturizer that hasn't broken me out. Use all over face, and a slightly heavier moisturizer on eyes and down hairline, where drier. After 40, and in steam-heated northeast winters, my skin started becoming noticably dry, esp in winter. This helps immensely.",
